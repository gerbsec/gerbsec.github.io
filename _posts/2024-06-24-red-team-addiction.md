# Addicted to Red Teaming

i have stages of my life where i get super addicted to a topic and i want to be the best at it. this doesn't need to be a thing i'm new at or anything. today it's red teaming. my plan is to refresh my mind on what i already know and get some new ttps up and running in my lab.

## the setup

i'll be setting up a baby lab on my pc made up of 3 machines, 2 workstations and a dc. i'll install crowdstrike on one, elastic on another, and finally i'll install simply defender on the third. the goal here is to ensure my payloads are up to date and if i need to bypass anything i can. i'll also introduce adcs vulns, kerberos vulns, default creds and more. i'll keep my website up with the latest and greatest as it happens. 

## exploit dev is not over...

red teaming will be my motivator for doing exploit dev, i'll only get to work on my lab and my payloads and more if i work on exploit dev. i need the osed within the next 20 days so i gotta lock in. 

## conclusion

anyways that's the entire update i had, i'll be posting more consistently about my progress.

best, gerbsec
