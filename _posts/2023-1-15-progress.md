## motivation

i finally feel like i have motivation again to do anything productive. i've been grinding really hard to get a few certs i've wanted for a minute now.
these certs will be pretty big in regards to my progress as a cyber professional. i finally feel like i can sit down and open my terminal and practice. simply practice, get better, and advance my knowledge.

## school

not a lot of classes in school, just enough to keep me ft but the same time be able to focus on work. a few classes will support my cert progress, so this is good.

## work 

work is good, hoping i get to focus and do that ft in the near future. i enjoy what i do and it's very niche so hopefully i get to do that for a while.

## life

i've noticed some things about me that i've been trying to get fixed up, namely i'm trying to be more open minded or at least (seem) open minded in the sense that even if i know i'm right, i won't shut out other people right away.
i will try to at least injest what they say and take it with a grain of salt and seem interested in what people have to say. this will help me with relationships and future leadership positions. i'm also trying to be a little less private
when it comes to life stuff with my close friends so that bad things aren't being assumed. 

## ctf

i'm planning on splitting my effort between wcsc and protosec in terms of where i'm allowed to play. if it's a uni ctf i'll play for wcsc and if not i'll prioritize protosec.
i also don't really care about supporting beginners that i don't know anymore. i can lead them in the correct direction, but if they aren't my friend i'm not planning on putting the effort. 


welp, i just came to do an update but ended up doing a tiny rant.

best, gerbsec
