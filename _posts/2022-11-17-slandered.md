## it's one thing to lose

it's one thing to lose an election fair and square and it's another thing to hear someone slander your name in front of everyone.
you know its bad when people are coming up to me telling me that i actually did do a great job and that what he said meant nothing to them, but i lost.

clearly what he said had an effect on people especially that there was > people that didn't know me than there was that did. so its easy to believe what he said.
getting slandered is just a double whammy on top of losing. losing would have been fine. i can accept losing, but my image has been ruined.

## there was no communication on his side

he complains about all these problems however they were never brought to anyone's attention, almost like he was holding on waiting for this moment. holding on to things
so he can go up and say hes the white knight coming to save us all. i for one know his work ethic more than anyone and that will not happen. this club will fail and crumble, unless he proves me wrong (and i hope he does). these are my genuine thoughts and im not afraid express them. i also know that no one, unless i get stalked, will read any of this :)

## if you think i don't like you, i probably don't

since i'm not president anymore i'm going to be more myself, if you have a feeling that i don't like you, it's because i don't. there's no sugar coating it. 

## next plans

i might go full time, and focus on work so i can save a few bucks. i might dual enroll with ucf (not a joke) and play on their team. maybe just apply for a masters.
these things are just thoughts at this point but I can def see them become reality. i've sacrificed a lot of for this club with little to no gain on my end. 

## final thoughts

regardless of what anyone thinks of me, they would have 0 thoughts about me if i didn't do what i did. i pulled this club from the lowest shit hole and saved it. i put us back on the map with a proper work ethic and drive to win. there is absolutely no denying it.
