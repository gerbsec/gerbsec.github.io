## welcome to my blog

- here i will discuss the many things that are going on in my life 
    - that could include CTFs, projects, and just general life stuff kinda like diary.
- i can start with this first one to talk about bsides CTF coming up on 2022-11-19 and life


## sunshine CTF bsides orlando

- i really want to win this one because it's hosted by our friends at UCF and RII
- we've been dealing with both those groups of people for a while so it's an interesting concept to win the challenges they made
- it will also show the florida community that a new team (not ucf) is on the rise and is coming for the title


i'm not too sure how i feel about it though, because as much as i want to win, i still don't feel like i have a team that has the same drive as i do.
most people are doing their own thing and no one really feels like they are part of a team or a greater cause. it gets annoying after a while and 
really ruins my motivation. i don't want to be the only one really grinding and practicing for it but it might end up being that way :/

as far as practice, i've been pulling the older sunshine ctf challenges and going through them, when stuck reading the writeups. this has been my main source of practice.
i've been worried about todays election but i think i have a solid grasp on this win. i might be biased but i'm prepared to deal with any outcome anyways so np. i'll be doing 
more practice when i finish work + hci project. lab and data structure should be good to go. 

i need to start losing weight soon. i always joke about this because it helps me cope but sometimes just sometimes im like damn i need to hit the treadmill or even just a jog outside. i've fixed my sleep schedule
i'm practically up at 7:30 am everyday so this will help facilitate that maybe. i just don't want it (my weight) to keep spiraling out of control.

i probably have a ton of spelling mistakes and i honestly could care less, this isn't a writeup or anything. it's my diary post for 2022-11-16 so deal with it ;)

best, gerbsec
