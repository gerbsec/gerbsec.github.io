## been a while

i thought i should write something because it's been a while since i wrote anything for my website. i've been pretty stand still cybersecurity wise. i went on a trip that lasted roughly 12 days and i'm back now with not much motivation. i've been mostly playing games and watching shows, but i'm already getting bored i can imagine i'll be grinding cyber security once again soon. i still want to focus on web exploitation while also doing nightmare slowly but steadily. as far as the web stuff goes my plan is one burp module, one htb ctf challenge, and one academy htb skill assessment for the next idek how long. then i'll take the cbbh. if i have time i'll also spend a little doing the pentest cert stuff to get it out of the way. 

## weight loss???

i'm competing with a friend of mine on a weight loss competition. i'm currently waiting for christmas to end so my gym opens up, but as soon as it does, i'm going to grind so unbelievably hard. i'm thinking about aiming for about 50 lbs, ik sounds insane but i am insane, so i think its possible.
i need to build a routine and possibly the best way to do it is by creating a google calendar cause it'll remind me on my phone. think that will be neat. 

## nearly daily writeups

i'll be aiming at publishing a ton of writeups, mainly on htb challenges and certain burp stuff i find interesting so keep an eye out for those.
that's all i got for today.

best, gerbsec
