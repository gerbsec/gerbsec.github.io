## CRTP Review and Guide

after a few years since i got the oscp in 2021 and a ton of other certs, i decided to start writing reviews and personal guides to how others can
succeed. 

## what is the crtp

the crtp or certified red team professional certification is a red team cert by altered security 

## the content

honestly it seems like the only way to go about doing this is by doing the bootcamp. the problem with that is that its not on your own pace and you have to watch nikhil go through the content. for me, thats a no go. so i did the self paced option where i just do wtv with the lab pdf and lab notes. 

i kinda skimmed through it and at this point ive got practically most of the basic ad stuff down so it as i was looking at this course, this seemed like a basic ad course that focused on powershell.

## the exam

25 hour exam with a 24 hour report period. with the goal of code exec on all the machines. it was honestly super easy, no flags to attain. if you know how to manuever a ad environment then you should have on problem doing this exam without any studying haha.

## who should get the crtp

its a fun course, nice to add and i would say even a guaranteed pass if you've done the cpts crto combo.

## how to prep

### read the pdf and lab writeup

the pdf with all the content doesn't even match the lab at the time i took the exam. but just skimming over the content i can tell it doesn't teach much that the crto and cpts don't. but reading those would help guide you towards the types of attacks you will need. they also taught me some nice (but outdated) techinques to bypassing av and amsi.

### not much

honestly can't think of much to add, its an easy course and exam

## conclusion

get the cert, its fun and teaches you some basic offensive powershell.

best, gerbsec
