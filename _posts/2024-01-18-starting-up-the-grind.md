## starting the grind again

so as you can see, I haven't been posting much. I've quite literally been so busy with everything irl so now that i'm easing into cyber again i want to start grinding some of these boxes. by some i mean all.

## hackthebox grind

i'm going to be doing all the retired machines on htb starting with the oldest and easiest to the newest and hardest. these will all come with writeups. 

i am posting this initial post as a way to keep me accountable. 

the schedule is going to be 1-2 machines a day except at the begenning when i'll be doing more because the early machines are braindead.

## cert grind

i have plans to start grinding certs soon, so this will help a lot in that process.

best,
