## GRIND TIME

I've been hardcore grinding htb, pg, and certs this month. I have a great group of friends that push me and i push them! I'm feeling good about this year!

Goal is to do 2 machines a day, one off of HTB and one off PG!

On top of that I have a goal of a module or two from the cert that I'm working on everyday.

This is tough with school and cyberherd and work but I can do it.

I've been going through a lot so being motivated again has been great!

GRIND TIMEEEEEE

best,
