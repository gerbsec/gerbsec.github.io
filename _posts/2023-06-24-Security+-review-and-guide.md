## Security + Review and Guide

## comptia sec + 

since these need to be as honest as possible, i will say it how it is. these suck and are total waste of time. 

they are multiple choice exams that you memorize a ton of terms answer them on the exam, and the minute you hit submit forget everything. its all very useless unless you work a managerial role instead of a techinical role. however, if you think that you want to do a technical role, this is a WASTE OF TIME. this also applies to like everything from comptia.

i spent a weekened studying and then took the exam and passed first try. wasted my time, but got it as my second cert for the sake of getting it. 

## how to prepare

im keeping this short, cause it really is dumb and not fun, but if you want to prepare then watch professor messer on youtube and download his slides. just read and take notes on all of em. if you don't think you are ready, take his practice exams. i think they are like $20 to buy from his website that is linked in his youtube channel and then take those over and over again until youget a 90%. from there just take the exam and you have a 90% chance you pass.

its dumb, and a waste of time. dont take these if you can avoid them.
