## overview

- lab was generally easy, there were some hiccups in regard to how openvpn works, no i'm kidding, and me missing obvious credentials but for the most part it was pretty easy.
- no correct path/order besides the obvious none vulnerable machines unless you have creds.
- shouldn't take longer than 2-3 days for anyone that knows what they are doing. personally i did it in a little over 2 days.

## the lab environment

- it's a very simple and straight forward environment. wide open network with all types of different machines.
- there's all sorts of vulnerabilites and as you do the lab you can tell it's meant to teach/familiarize a newer pentester with the concepts at play
- there's little to no defensive measures on any of the boxes, no need to bypass anything.

## tips

- hackthebox made the lab, therefore hackthebox academy is where you should look for help.
- anytime i was stuck i'd look at academy and, of course, i find the solution. 
- join the lab with an open mind. if you are newer to pentesting be ready to do a lot of googling, as there is 1 or 2 almost intermediate level boxes that might trip you up.

## final thoughts

- tons of fun regardless of the difficulty, going for dante next and building my way up!
